A Java project developed by students during the https://github.com/oliviercailloux/java-course[Java course] taught at Université Paris-Dauphine (in https://dauphine.psl.eu/formations/licences/informatique-des-organisations/l3-methodes-informatiques-appliquees-pour-la-gestion-des-entreprises[L3 MIAGE Alternance]).

 == Iteration 1

 [IMPORTANT]
 ====
 Deadline : **Febrary the 14th,** 2021
 This file only explains the distribution of work between the different teams and indicates their realization.
 ====
 NOTE: The first iteration does not reflect the countless hours we spent understanding the projet. We aim, in the future, to create a global doc in order to explain the main functionalities and how to manage it.

 === Ewen MARGUET & Seif BOUGUERRA

 * SM/PO for this iteration.
 * Have split the work between the two groups.
 * Organized meetings throughout the week to have a better understanding of the projet.
 * Made sure everybody was on board and respected the deadline.

 === Maïrame NDIAYE & Abla MIKOU

 * Modifying the global_UC Diagram: Deleting unrelated information, and changing the main interaction with Tenant.
 * Adding a generalized interaction "Manage apartments" with two sub-divisions.
 * Modifying CreateApartmentsUC: Changing the whole diagram. Renaming it ManageApartments, with two main use cases "Modify Apartment" and "Create Apartment". Then, adding "Modify fields" and interactions.

 === Samy MEGUENI & Stellan WEA

 * Modifying AskOpinionForUtilityUC: Merge different parameters, modify title to a more efficient name. Transform "extends" in "uses"
 * Create SetPreferencesUC: Adding different interaction with the main user (Tenant)

 === Ewen MARGUET & Abla MIKOU

 * Creating ID_valuefonction : Creating an Interaction Diagram of valuefunction. As long as the user wants to put criterias, we compute again the appartments' score and show the best appartments corresponding to this criterias. **(prerequisites : correcting conceptual errors in model)**
 * Correcting conceptual errors in model. **(mandatory first step)**
 * Update GlobalUC : adding the possibility to show statistics and to compare 2 apartments chosen by the user, deleting unrelated information, and changing the main interaction with Tenant. **(prerequisites : correcting conceptual errors in model)**

 === Seif BOUGUERRA & Stellan WEA

 * Creating DC_DistanceApartment : Class diagram to describe attributes' and classes' behaviour implied in distance calculation and interaction between them (DistanceSubway, ValueDistFunction & InterfacePartialValueFunction) and ID_GetDistance : Sequence diagram that allows to obtain a distance value between the flat and any place of interest.**(prerequisites : correcting conceptual errors in model)**
 * Update pictures and contents from Github : Some contents are not updated, for example, pictures of diagrams that didn't exist. **(prerequisites : need the DC_DistanceApartment)**
 * Documentation for a future spider-plot to compare 2 apartments chosen by the user according to several criterias. **(no prerequisites)**

 === Seif BOUGUERRA & Samy MEGUENI

 * Explanation of the Spider-Plot : Creating a Sequences Diagram that explains the interactions between the user, the value function and the GUI. Writing a better version of the spider-plot's documentation provided at iteration two.
Creating a Spider-Plot class diagram that shows how it's possible to compare two apartments according to the values returned from the ValueFunction.
 * Repair Stereotypes (not really a real task) : Trying to remove this dialogue box with opening the eclipse project.

 === Maïrame NDIAYE & Ewen MARGUET


 * Include Spider-plot in existing diagram(s) : Improvement of the current class diagram(s) linked to the use/display of the spider-plot.
 * Create a Use Case diagram AdaptValueFonction : Find new questions (more relevant) and ask them to the potential tenant. Use the answers to recalculate the value fonction to have more relevant score. And a documentation that explains how we will integer the new answers in the calculation of the value fonction.
 * API_key : Search through Internet the API_key.txt that enables to launch the distance class program between two places.
