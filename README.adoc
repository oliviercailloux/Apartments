== Itérations UML 2021

=== Iteration 1 UML

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deadline : **Febrary the 14th,** 2021
This file only explains the distribution of work between the different teams and indicates their realization.
====
NOTE: The first iteration does not reflect the countless hours we spent understanding the projet. We aim, in the future, to create a global doc in order to explain the main functionalities and how to manage it.

==== Ewen MARGUET & Seif BOUGUERRA

 * SM/PO for this iteration.
 * Have split the work between the two groups.
 * Organized meetings throughout the week to have a better understanding of the projet.
 * Made sure everybody was on board and respected the deadline.

 * Modifying the global_UC Diagram: Deleting unrelated information, and changing the main interaction with Tenant.
 * Adding a generalized interaction "Manage apartments" with two sub-divisions.
 * Modifying CreateApartmentsUC: Changing the whole diagram. Renaming it ManageApartments, with two main use cases "Modify Apartment" and "Create Apartment". Then, adding "Modify fields" and interactions.

==== Samy MEGUENI & Stellan WEA

=== Itération 4 UML

[IMPORTANT]
====
Deadline : **May the 3rd, ** 2021
This file only explains the distribution of work between the different teams and indicates their realization.
====

==== Samy MEGUENI & Ewen MARGUET

* SM/PO for this iteration.
* Have split the work between the two groups.
* Daily meeting to know where we stand.
* Make sure everybody is on board and respect the deadline.
* We decided to adopt the professor's suggestions.

==== Abla MIKOU & Seif BOUGUERRA

* Create DistanceValueFunction which will replace ValueDistFunction : for this, we modify `DC Global Detailed`, `DC Global Simplified`, `DC Package ValueFunction` and the documentation.
* Document changes the implementation of DistanceValueFunction in the ApartmentValueFunction will make.

* The french detailed version is listed below :
 ** Créer DistanceValueFunction, qui remplacera ValueDistFunction, qui actuellement ne rend pas du tout le service qu’elle est censée rendre.
 *** Doc visée : principalement un diagramme de classe et qqs ajouts textuels ou graphiques (voir ci-dessous).
 *** À l’initialisation, la classe reçoit un ensemble de LatLng représentant les lieux d’intérêts d’un utilisateur et éventuellement une PVF<Double> qui donne la valeur de l’utilisateur d’un temps de trajet exprimé en secondes.
 *** Par défaut, la PVF est la fonction linéaire par morceau utilisée actuellement dans ValueDistFunction.
 *** getSubjectiveValue(LatLng) reçoit la localisation d’un appartement et renvoie la valeur moyenne de la distance en secondes de l’appartement à un lieu d’intérêt (valeurs calculées grâce à la PVF).
 *** Documenter (textuellement + graphiquement avec un plot de la fonction) le rôle et le fonctionnement de la PVF.
 ** Documenter les changements à effectuer pour pouvoir ajouter une DistanceValueFunction (donc un nouveau critère) dans AVF.
 *** Qu’est-ce que ça change en général dans le logiciel ? Revoir toute la doc et indiquer les changements à prévoir à chaque endroit. Par exemple, il est actuellement possible (à vérifier) de sauvegarder les AVFs ; quel sera l’impact de l’ajout de ce critère sur cet aspect ?
 *** S’inspirer du début d’implémentation proposée dans la link:https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/projet-apartments/pull/23[PR #23] : quels tests unitaires échouent suite à cet ajout, pourquoi, comment résoudre ces problèmes ?

==== Maïrame NDIAYE & Stellan WEA

* Class diagram for SpiderPlot in order to show its interactions with ohter packages.
* Class diagram of SpiderPlot to display its internal functionning.
* Update the `SD_ValueFunction` diagram taking into account the professor's comments. It will allow the user to understand how he modifies the sorted list of apartments by answering new questions. link:https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/projet-apartments/pull/19[(PR #19)]

* The french detailed version is listed below :
 ** Diagramme de classe montrant la place de SpiderPlot dans l’architecture et son interaction avec d’autres packages, mettant à jour les diagrammes existants.
 ** Diagramme de la classe SpiderPlot détaillé, et éventuellement d’autres classes liées, montrant son fonctionnement interne et ce qu’il permet ; en vue d’une implémentation en Java.

All of these tasks are related to the 2nd iteration of java : link:https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/projet-apartments/pull/27[PR #27]
