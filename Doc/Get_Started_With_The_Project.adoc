== What's inside projet apartments ?

Inside the project, you have three main topics. Under the folder link:Doc[Doc], you will find everything you need for your UML iterations. Indeed, and we will explain into details later, you will find diagrams, documentation about the different functions and futures ideas.
Under the folder link:src[src], you have the java code you need to work on. Last but not least, the README.adoc allows you to understand what we've done this past year.
