== Package

* Global package diagram

== Class

* Global class diagram (simplified)

image::diagram-class-global-simplified.svg?raw=true[Global class diagram (simplified)]

This is a class diagram to describe interactions between each package of the projet-apartments. Here, we especially added the Plot package in the diagram so that we can understand its interactions with the other packages. More details regarding the classes and methods interactions are available in the `diagram-class-global-detailed`.

* Plot class package diagram

We decided to implement a SpiderPlot in order to compare two apartments based on the subjective values of their criterias. This way the Tenant will have a better summary of its choices. Below is an example of the result the Tenant will get by clicking on the SpiderPlot button.

In the Java implementation, we created the `plot` package that contains the `SpiderPlot` class. It generates a SpiderPlot having in parameters two adresses and an AVF.

This class diagram gives a representation of the java implementation of this package and its class. We added, following the Teacher's recommandations, details about CategoryDataset interface and the JFreechart class to have a better overall understanding.

== Use case

* Global use case diagram

* Orange bubbles mean this is yet to be implemented. 

Tenant has two main interactions.
Firstly, Tenant must set his preferences in order to get an ordered list of apartments.
Based on the foregoing, he can compare two apartments using the SpiderPlot.
Secondly, Tenant can generate global database statistics.

A XOR constraint is implemented with the Generate database statistics. 
It means that this use case is used ONLY by one person at the time.


== Sequence Diagrams

* Diagram Sequence Value Function

image::diagram-sequence-valueFonction.png?raw=true[ValueFunction Sequence Diagram]

The goal of this sequence diagram is to show that the tenant has the possibility to ask some new questions in order to get a more refined list of apartments. 

List of classes/methods that will be implemented in java : 
`Orchestrator class` and its methods : `showAOFU()`, `showLAG()`,`moreQuestionsClick()`,`addAnswerClick()`, `finishButtonClick()` and `chooseApartmentClick()`.
AOFU methods : `askMoreQuestion()` and `adaptAVF()`.
LAG method : `updateAVF()`.

Some details on these class and methods are available below.

`Orchestrator` class : as its name shows, this class will be used to orchestrate the showing of the AOFU and LAG screen.
If the tenant wants to refine his search, he can click on the button `askMoreQuestions` that will push the Orchestrator to call the `moreQuestionsClick()` method that will display a new question. 
Then, when the tenant answer to the question, Orchestrator will use `adaptAVF()` method in order to recalculate the AVF of the apartments.
Afterwards, when the tenant click's on the `finish` button, the Orchestrator calls the `showLAG()` to use its methods which are able to sort the list and display it.

`askMoreQuestions()` and `adaptAVF()` methods : they're not already implemented in `AskOpinionForUtility`. 
The former will check if there are available questions and if yes, display one to the tenant (we didn't determind yet how is chosen the question). 
The latter method takes as parameters an avf and a criterion list. It will enable to recalculate avf apartments according to the given parameters. 

Once the tenant gets a new sorted list of apartments, if he's satisfied, he has the opportunity to select an apartment, otherwise, he isn't blocked and is free to do what he wants.
