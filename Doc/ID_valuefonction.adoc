=== Diagram Sequence Value Function

* The Tenant can add preferences as long as he is not satisfied with the current ordered list of apartments, and that there are still some questions to ask.

* When the Tenant clicks on "Ask more questions", the AskOpinionForUtility class will make sure there is more questions and will ask it.

* Once the Tenant answers it, the same class will retain the answer and will invoke AVF methods to recompute the value of the apartments.

* After this, AskOpinionForUtility will invoke LayoutApartmentGUI to display the new ordered list of apartments with the new preferences.

* If one of the condition of the loop is not true anymore, then we enter the "break"  which means the Tenant chose an apartment.
