* Orange bubbles mean this is yet to be implemented. 

=== For the Tenant :

* Tenant has two main interactions
* Firstly, Tenant must set his preferences in order to get an ordered list of apartments.
* Based on the foregoing, he can compare two apartments using the SpiderPlot.
* Secondly, Tenant can generate global database statistics.

=== For the Manager side :

* Manager has two interactions
* First, he manages apartments. This means he either creates a new apartment or modifies an existing one.
* Second, Manager can also generate global databse statistics

==== XOR explanation :

* a XOR constraint is implemented with the Generate database statistics. It means that this use case is used ONLY by one person at the time.
